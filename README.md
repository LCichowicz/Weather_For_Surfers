This program runs continuously. 
It loads, periodically, weather forecast data for a specific location. 
Data is collected from Visual Crossing Corporation. 
The program analyzes this data. If the program finds good weather conditions for windsurfings, it will send notifications and weather graph to surfers. 
These notifications (e-mail) are sent two days in advance and repeated the day before the event.
Below is an example of a weather chart sent to surfers
